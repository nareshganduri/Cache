Thread-safe and non-thread-safe variants of lazily-evaluated expressions, also known as [thunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk).

No idea if they actually work, written mostly as an exercise in designing thread-safe data structures using only safe Rust.

See [main.rs](/src/main.rs) for example usage.
